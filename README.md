# Brumhack2016  
This project was created at Brumhack 2016, A 24 hour hackathon. 
The project encompasses the Leap Motion controller for motion based control in a simple Jenga game. 
The game is in an unfinished state, and eventually will be finished.
## Things to do
* Make the pinching motion smoother
* Allow blocks to clip to the 'Hand' object, to allow for easier removal.
* Add multiplayer
* Add mouse controls so the game can be played without leap motion

## Stretch Goals
* Port to mobile
* Add scoring and scoreboard
* Add different game modes
